3.3 Exercises
-------------

### 3.1 ###

Given the knowledge base:-

    descend(X,Y) :- child(X,Y).
    descend(X,Y) :- child(X,Z),
                    descend(Z,Y).

Would it be problematic to reformulate this to:

descend5.prolog:-

    child(anne,bridget).
    child(bridget,caroline).
    child(caroline,donna).
    child(donna,emily).

    descend(X,Y) :- child(X,Y).
    descend(X,Y) :- descend(X,Z),
                    descend(Z,Y).

Yes, as you would get infinite recursion as Prolog tries to match __descend(X, Z)__ with
a __Z__ when using the second rule whenever you happened to look at a query for which the
knowledge base didn't have a solution. Note that changing __child(Z,Y)__ to __descend(Z,Y)__
doesn't have any impact, other than to create another potential source of infinite recursion,
however this is usually not going to have much impact considering the first instance of
recursion in the body will cause a problem before it does.

### 3.2 ###

Looking at Russian dolls:-

Write a KB using the predicate __directlyIn/2__ which encodes which doll is contained direction
in which other doll. Then declare __in/2__ which tells us which doll is (directly or
indirectly) contained in other dolls.

dolls.prolog:-

    directlyIn(katarina,olga).
    directlyIn(olga,natasha).
    directlyIn(natasha,irina).

    in(X,Y):- directlyIn(X,Y).

    in(X,Y):-
        directlyIn(X,Z),
        in(Z,Y).

### 3.3 ###

We have the following knowledge base:-

    directTrain(saarbruecken,dudweiler).
    directTrain(forbach,saarbruecken).
    directTrain(freyming,forbach).
    directTrain(stAvold,freyming).
    directTrain(fahlquemont,stAvold).
    directTrain(metz,fahlquemont).
    directTrain(nancy,metz).

Write a recursive predicate __travelFromTo/2__ which tells us where we can travel by train
between two towns, e.g. __travelFromTo(nancy,saarbruecken)__ should return true.

travel.prolog:-

    directTrain(saarbruecken,dudweiler).
    directTrain(forbach,saarbruecken).
    directTrain(freyming,forbach).
    directTrain(stAvold,freyming).
    directTrain(fahlquemont,stAvold).
    directTrain(metz,fahlquemont).
    directTrain(nancy,metz).

    travelFromTo(X,Y):- directTrain(X,Y).
    travelFromTo(X,Y):- directTrain(Y,X).

    travelFromTo(X,Y):-
        directTrain(X,Z),
        travelFromTo(Z,Y).

    travelFromTo(X,Y):-
        directTrain(Y,Z),
        travelFromTo(Z,X).

### 3.4 ###

Define a predicate __greater\_than/2__ which takes two numerals in the notation we described
earlier, and determines whether the first numeral is greater than the second numeral.

greater_than.prolog:-

    greater_than(X, 0):- X \= 0.

    greater_than(succ(X), succ(Y)):-
        greater_than(X,Y).

### 3.5 ###

Binary trees are trees where all internal nodes have exactly 2 children. Leaves are the
smallest component, which we represent __leaf(X)__. We represent trees/subtrees as
__tree(X,Y)__.

Design a predicate __swap/2__, which produces the mirror image of the binary tree that is its
first argument, e.g.:-

    ?- swap(tree(tree(leaf(1), leaf(2)), leaf(4)),T).
    T = tree(leaf(4), tree(leaf(2), leaf(1))).

tree.prolog:-

    leaf(X).
