Exercises/Chapter 5 - Arithmetic
--------------------------------

### 5.1 ###

How does Prolog respond to the following X?

    1. X =  3*4.

    X = 3*4.

    2. X  is  3*4.

    X = 12.

    3. 4  is  X.

    Error: Not fully instantiated.

    4. X  =  Y.

    X = Y.

    5. 3  is  1+2.

    true.

    6. 3  is  +(1,2).

    true.

    7. 3  is  X+2.

    Error: Not fully instantiated.

    8. X  is  1+2.

    X = 3.

    9. 1+2  is  1+2.

    false - 3 \= +(1,2).

    10. is(X,+(1,2)).

    X = 3.

    11. 3+2  =  +(3,2).

    true.

    12. *(7,5)  =  7*5.

    True.

    13. *(7,+(3,2))  =  7*(3+2).

    True.

    14. *(7,(3+2))  =  7*(3+2).

    True.

    15. 7*3+2  =  *(7,+(3,2)).

    False.

    16. *(7,(3+2))  =  7*(+(3,2)).

    True.

### 5.2 ###

1. Define a 2-place predicate increment that holds only when its second argument is an integer
   one larger than its first argument, e.g. __increment(4,5)__ should hold, but
   __increment(4,6)__ should not.

    increment(X,Y):-
        1 is Y-X.

2. Define a 3-place predicate sum that holds only when its third argument is the sum of the
first two arguments, e.g. __sum(4,5,9)__ should hold, but __sum(4,6,12)__ should not.

    sum(X,Y,S):-
        S is X+Y.

### 5.3 ###

Write a predicate __addone/2__ whose first argument is a list of integers, and whose second
argument is the list of integers obtained by adding 1 to each integer in the first list. For
example, the following should hold:-

    ?- addone([1,2,7,2], X).
    X = [2,3,8,3].

    rev([], R, R).
    rev([H|T], A, R):-
        rev(T, [H|A], R).

    addOne([],A,R):-
        rev(A,[],R).
    addOne([H|T], A, R):-
        N is H+1,
        addOne(T, [N|A], R).

TODO: Irritating to have to reverse the list here, perhaps a better way?
