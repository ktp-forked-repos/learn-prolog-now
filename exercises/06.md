Exercises/Chapter 6 - More Lists
--------------------------------

### 6.1 ###

A list is 'doubled' if it is made of two consecutive blocks of elements that are exactly same,
e.g. [a,b,c,a,b,c] is doubled. Write a predicate __doubled(List)__ which succeeds when __List__
is a doubled list.

    doubled(List):-
        append(X,X,List).
